# Concept as C++
## Ancient
> has the functions written with C in order to implement.  
> its generic defines the method for it to work.  
> it would have been defined similar to the following code.
```cpp
template<>
class _WhateverAncient<Whatever::Plain>;
```

## Ordered
> With class you could choose its data type you'd store and method to work.
